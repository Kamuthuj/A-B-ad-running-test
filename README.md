# Marketing A/B testing analysis

# Project overview.
This project focuses on analyzing data from an A/B testing experiment conducted in a marketing campaign. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and uncover actionable insights. The dataset includes user interactions, conversion status, and details about peak ad engagement times.

# Data preprocessing.
Preprocessing steps involved:

1. Handling duplicates.
2. Removing unnecessary columns.
3. Assessing and encoding categorical variables.
These steps ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysi

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Univariate Analysis
Visualizations: Count plots, pie charts, histograms, and box plots were used to explore data distributions and identify patterns.
Key metrics such as user interactions and ad engagement times were analyzed for trends.
2. Bivariate Analysis
Cross-tabulations and visualizations assessed conversion rates by test groups, days, and hours.
Comparisons of total ad views were made between converted and non-converted users.

# Statistical Testing

To validate findings:
Chi-square tests were used for assessing associations between categorical variables.
Non-parametric tests were employed for numeric variables, addressing unmet normality assumptions.
Significant differences in conversion rates were identified, offering valuable insights into user behavior and campaign performance.
